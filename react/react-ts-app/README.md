# Digital Twin Hub (Frontend)

This is a small React + TypeScript project built to understand how frontend state can be structured in a predictable way.

The app shows a list of devices used at a site (sensors, cameras, controllers).  
Users can search and filter devices, select one, and inspect its details.

Editing a device is handled through a simple workflow:
- View mode
- Edit mode
- Save or cancel

Saving changes is simulated on the UI only.  
There is no backend or data persistence by design.

## Tech Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Hooks and reducers

## Purpose
This project focuses on:
- State modeling
- UI workflows
- Controlled updates

Not on design, backend, or databases.
